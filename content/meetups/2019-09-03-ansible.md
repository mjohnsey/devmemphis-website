Join us as we dive into Ansible, the server management tool designed to help developers keep servers configured properly and running smoothly. We'll cover the basics and dive into some in-depth configuration options so you can stop treating your servers like pets: which you constantly have to feed and water. Join us as we learn how to turn those pets into cattle in your server farm and turn your infrastructure into code!

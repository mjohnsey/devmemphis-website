MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Cats are… well, cats. In this talk, I’ll discuss a bit about why MsgPack exists, it’s pros and cons, and how I used it for science, followed by a Schrödinger’s Cat themed demonstration in Java, Python, and Go.

Ever feel like you’re out of your league? Like you don’t know enough? Like you’re not cut out for your job.

Surprise; even the best and most experienced pros struggle with these feelings; it comes with holding yourself to a high standard and it’s totally normal.

This month at DevMemphis user group, Harold will be giving a talk about imposter syndrome. It’s a topic relevant not just to devs but to anyone who’s passionate about what they do.

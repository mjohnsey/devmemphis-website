A non-partisan exploration of how technology skills can impact politics, elections, and government. Learn how your tech expertise can make a difference in modern democracy. This talk will not focus on any specific parties or candidates, and all perspectives are welcome as long as they are shared respectfully. Our goal is to keep the session focused on the role of technology without diving into debates or advocacy.

OpenAPI for Fun and Profit

Building service-oriented applications today usually requires a solution for maintaining the interface between the service and the client code. Documenting a REST service with a tool like OpenAPI provides many benefits and with new tools can also create the boilerplate code necessary to call the service, speeding up development and taking human error out of the equation. In this talk, we will explore an example of using Python’s FastAPI web framework to create an API that is self-documenting and use OpenAPI Generator and data-model-code-generator to auto-generate client code that talks with the API.

description: Celebrating the first year of DevMemphis
---

This month marks one year of DevMemphis!

A little over a year ago, some Memtech user group organizers were struggling to keep attendance up and find engaging speakers to cover niche topics so they decided to try something different. DevMemphis was created as a general-purpose programming user group and in it’s first year it has accomplished the goal of bringing great talks to a larger audience.

Over the past year, we’ve hosted 10 amazing meetups with great talks and discussions (we took a couple of months off for holidays) and we’re excited for more to come.

## Special Thanks

Dev Memphis would not be possible without everyone who has attended or presented at DevMemphis meetups. Special thanks also goes to Vaco Memphis, who has been a part of the DevMemphis story by sponsoring the meetup and providing pizza, as well as the FedEx Institute of Technology and the Memphis Technology Foundation,

Here's to a great first year of Meetups and more to come
